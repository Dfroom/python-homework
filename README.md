This is my submission for my Module 2 Assignment, pibank.


The following lines of code were created with input from TA Mehdi Lebdi during the August 31st office hours:

greatest_increase = ["", 0]
greatest_decrease = ["", 0]

if change > greatest_increase[1]:
            greatest_increase[0] = row[0]
            greatest_increase[1] = change
if change < greatest_decrease[1]:
            greatest_decrease[0] = row[0]
            greatest_decrease[1] = change
I have added notes above these lines of code indicating they were created during office hours with input.
I also used in-class demos and problem sets as inspiration and guide.

Thank you for taking the time to read this whole file and grade my assignment!
